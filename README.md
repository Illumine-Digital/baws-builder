# What is this?

It's an ansible playbook, designed primarily for usage with bAWS Builder at https://baws.io to build high performance, PHP driven, Drupal or WordPress optimized serverss, on the Amazon Linux 2 AMI. 

Since BAWS Builder is just a GUI, you may use this without BAWS builder if you're familiar with AWS. However, BAWS Builder was developed for a reason; it simplifies a lot of tedious tasks.

This is in alpha stages, and still constantly evolving. Some bugs expected.

Gettig started guid, examples and a GUI are in the works. Please contact me via GitHub if you'd like to learn more or contribute.
